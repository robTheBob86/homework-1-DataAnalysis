# homework-1-DataAnalysis

The first homework for the module Data Analysis for Engineers of the Technical University of Munich.
Simply some plotting tasks and simple algorithms.

I cannot provide the scripts and basic data where the problems have been run on, I will only show the code for reference purposes.
Please note that all the scripts have been **written and run in the Spyder environment**.
